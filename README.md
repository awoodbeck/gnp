# Network Programming with Go
Code repository for [Network Programming with Go](https://nostarch.com/networkprogrammingwithgo) from
No Starch Press.

Although this book was targeted for developers familiar with the Go programming language, it's
reasonable to assume that you may have picked it up early in your journey of mastering Go. If you
aren't comfortable running the tests and examples presented in the book you can either clone this
repository and run it on your operating system's command line, or run them in a Docker container.

## Running the examples on your command line:

Make sure you have `git` installed on your command line. If not, these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli)
should get you started.

First, clone this repository by clicking on the green `Code` button near the top of this page and
selecting the appropriate command. To clone the repository over HTTPS, run:

    git clone https://github.com/awoodbeck/gnp.git

To clone the repository over SSH, run this command:

    git clone git@github.com:awoodbeck/gnp.git

Once cloned, you can change into the `gnp` directory and run all of the tests, like so:

    cd gnp
    go test -timeout 300s -race -bench=. ./...
    
Alternatively, run the tests from a single chapter:

    go test -v -timeout 300s -race -bench=. ./ch03/dial_fanout_test.go

## Run examples in a Docker container:

First, ensure Docker is installed by following [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for your operating system.

Next, install the [latest docker-buildx release](https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/latest) for your operating system.

Then, clone this repository and build the `gnp` docker container by running the following commands 
in the `gnp` directory:

    git clone git@github.com:awoodbeck/gnp.git
    cd gnp
    docker-buildx build -t gnp .

Once finished, you should see a `gnp` image in the output of the `docker image ls`
command, like this:

```bash
$ docker image ls                                                                                                                                                                                             âœ— master
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
gnp          latest    ce9980c7834f   8 minutes ago    1.07GB
```

Finally, you can run the container using the `docker run --rm -it gnp bash`
command. You should find yourself at a bash prompt where you can run the tests
by issuing the `go test -race ./...` command, for example, as seen below:

```bash
root@7f00d5d8ad21:/usr/src/gnp# go test -race ./...

## What's `gnp` in the context of this repository?

`gnp` was the acronym for the book's working name, "Go Network Programming." The book's name evolved 
while in development, but the repository did not. Before publishing, my energy was entirely focused
on completing the book, and I couldn't justify renaming this repository and correcting all
references to it while the book's deadline loomed. Perhaps in the second edition.
